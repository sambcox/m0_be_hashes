# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

    - Colons vs fat arrows! It is interesting that the data type matters when using either one.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

    - It is going well! I have been breaking my notes up day by day, lesson by lesson, and this helps when I need to find something quickly.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
    - I prefer to solve it on my own, but I am not averse to googling!
